# MesosBenchMark
A small mesos bench mark intended to run with a lightweight framework consits with a - Cluster manager, N Node BackEnds and a minimal client.
The project goals will do the followings:
1) Measuring mesos perfomance under heterogeneous and none heterogeneous task enviorement.
2) Measuring various metrics with n instances of the given FrameWork.
3) All data will be analysed and displayed with Kibana by analyzing the benchmark logs.
 the project is written in C++, include ProtoBuf+GRPC for inter communication with in the disterbuted framework outside of mesos.
